# Algorithms

I'm currently reading the book "Grokking Algorithms: An illustrated guide for programmers and other curious people" and I will be using this project to:

- Replicate in C# the book PHP codes examples.
- Solve the book challenges.
- Apply the algorithms in different contexts that I might wanna try.
